# It's me, Jezer

I like to do things I like, such as learning and helping people!

In love with the terminal, and some low-level things.

NOTE: I'm currently fighting with Windows VMs due to college nonsense, so I can't develop
my own Linux stuff. I'll be back later in June~

NOTE 2: Yeah... still busy. Not even in June. Maybe, perhaps, I'd be back in August.
